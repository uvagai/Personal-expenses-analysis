# Personal-expenses-analysis
This project simulates a personal expense tracker using synthetic data from the Faker library. Monthly expenses are stored in an SQL database and analyzed through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). A Streamlit app visualizes insights, showing spending patterns, trends, and actionable recommendations for better financial management.
