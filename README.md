#  Analyzing Personal Expenses

##  Project Overview
This project simulates and analyzes personal expense data using Python, SQL, and Streamlit. It showcases how an individual can track and understand their spending behavior through realistic data generated with the Faker library. The data is stored in a SQL database, queried for insights, and visualized using an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

##  Problem Statement
The goal is to build an end-to-end expense tracker that:
- Simulates realistic monthly expenses.
- Stores data in a structured SQL database.
- Analyzes spending habits using SQL queries.
- Visualizes results using an interactive web app built with Streamlit.

##  Skills Used
- Python  
- SQL  
- Streamlit  
- Faker  
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)  
- Data Visualization  

##  Project Workflow

1. **Data Simulation**  
   Generate realistic expense data using the Faker library for 12 months.

2. **Database Creation**  
   Design a SQL schema and load the data into monthly tables.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Use Python libraries to explore spending patterns and trends.

4. **SQL Querying**  
   Write 25-30 insightful SQL queries to understand expense distribution, monthly patterns, cashback trends, etc.

5. **Streamlit App**  
   Develop an interactive app to visualize query results with charts and filters.

6. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   Derive actionable insights to optimize spending and improve financial planning.

##  Key Questions Answered
- What is the total amount spent in each category?
- Which payment mode is used most frequently?
- How much cashback was earned each month?
- What are the top 5 most expensive categories?
- Are there any recurring or seasonal expenses?
- (And 20+ more insights...)
